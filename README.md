## CS50P course problem set solutions

### Introduction
Welcome to the repository containing my solutions for the CS50P course problem sets and the final project. This course, offered by Harvard University, is an introduction to programming with Python, covering a wide range of fundamental concepts. This repository is designed to showcase my understanding and application of these concepts.

### Repository structure
Repository contains 9 folders coresponding with 9 weeks of course. Week 0 - Week 8 contains problem sets and Week 9 contains final project.

### Final Project
The final project is a culmination of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course. Recipe Collector is an intuitive application that delivers recipes right to your inbox. Whether you want a single meal or a whole day menu - you are covered!.

### Usage
To use these solutions as a reference:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Marius-Sn1p/CS50P
Navigate to the desired problem set or the final project folder.
Review the code and documentation provided.
